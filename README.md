The purpose of this game is to find your way to the top level of the maze by smashing and clibing the boxes around you.
You can exit any time by pressing 'X', pause the game by pressing 'P', change view with 'R' (rotation camera) or 'V' (top view camera).
Press 'E' to win as soon as you reach the top level!

You gain points as you smash boxes and sometimes collect hammers. Each hammer has its own hammerLife so use them with causion.

It utilizes the standar unity movement contror (W,A,S,D,space) and the left click to control the hammer.

Find the black boxes and step into them!

In order to try my game you have to build it.. If you are familiar with Unity you know how it's done.
If not.. Download the content of MazeESC, make a new project and import the downloaded files there, then build it for your desired platform (a research in the web is almost anavoidable if you fall in this category, so do it!).

This game is my first unity project and it's far from perfect, if you have something to comment on my code or in any aspect of this project please do. Let me know your thoughts.
